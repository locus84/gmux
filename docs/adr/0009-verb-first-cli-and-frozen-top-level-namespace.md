# ADR 0009: Verb-first CLI, explicit run syntax, and a criterion for top-level verbs

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-06-15
**Supersedes (in part):** the flag-based action surface of ADR 0005 (the
*transport* decision in 0005 stands; only the user-facing flag grammar changes)

## Context

Before 2.0, `gmux` exposed session actions as mutually-exclusive boolean
flags (`--list`, `--attach`, `--tail`, `--kill`, `--send`, `--wait`,
`--no-attach`, `--host`, `--all`) while the `gmuxd` daemon binary used
verbs (`start`, `run`, `stop`, `status`, `auth`, `remote`, `log-path`).
Two grammars, one product. The flag grammar also required ~150 lines of
hand-rolled mutual-exclusion and interspersed-flag parsing in `cli.go`.

For 2.0 we unify on a single **verb-first** grammar fronted by the
`gmux` binary, and we settle how a command-to-run is expressed.

## Decision

1. **All user-facing actions are verbs under `gmux`.** Session verbs:
   `open`, `ls`, `attach`, `tail`, `send`, `wait`, `kill` (plus `help`,
   `version`). Each verb owns its own flag set; the global
   mutual-exclusion maze is deleted.

2. **`gmux open` is the single canonical UI-launch verb.** No `ui`/`app`
   aliases. (`open` is a verb, consistent grammar, and matches
   `xdg-open`/`gh browse` intuitions.) The web client remains the
   **Frontend** in the glossary; `open` names the *action*, not the thing.

3. **Bare `gmux` prints help.** It has no side effects — in particular it
   does **not** auto-start the daemon.

4. **Running a command is explicit: `gmux -- <cmd> [args…]`.** There is no
   `run` verb (so `run` is not a reserved word) and **no bare shorthand**
   (`gmux pytest` is an "unknown command" error, not "run pytest").
   Power users who want terseness alias `gm='gmux --'` — which is shorter
   than the old shorthand and lives in their shell, not the tool.

5. **Top-level verbs are operations on sessions addressed by id.** This
   criterion keeps common operations composable with the standard addressing,
   exit taxonomy, and daemon auto-start contract. `promote` and `reparent`
   therefore belong beside `wait`, `tail`, and `kill`. Namespace groups are
   reserved for non-session domains (`agent`, `daemon`) and setup (`auth`,
   `remote`). The unreleased `gmux session promote|demote|reparent` group and
   `gmux read` experiment are superseded before release; consumption remains an
   observation side effect rather than a mutation verb.

   **Local distribution amendment (2026-09-02):** `dismiss` joins the
   top-level session verbs. `gmux dismiss <id>` is leaf-only; a session that
   owns descendants requires `--tree`, making recursive family scope explicit
   at the CLI boundary. `project` is a namespace group for daemon-owned project
   catalog operations; `gmux project add <path>` adds or returns a matching
   local project. The retired `session dismiss` and `workspace add` spellings
   are not restored.

6. **`gmux daemon …` is the canonical front; `gmuxd` keeps its verbs for
   backwards-compatible ops.** `gmux daemon start|stop|restart|status|
   log-path`, `gmux auth`, and `gmux remote` are the documented surface
   and bridge (thin `exec`) to the `gmuxd` binary, which retains its
   existing verbs (`run`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `status`, `auth`,
   `remote`, `log-path`; bare `gmuxd` prints help, `gmuxd run` serves
   foreground). The bridge keeps a **single implementation** (in gmuxd)
   rather than copying lifecycle code into gmux.

   This deliberately steps back from "strip `gmuxd` to bare-serve only."
   Rationale: the constraint that drove top-level minimalism — shorthand
   collisions — is gone (decision 4 dropped the shorthand), and daemon
   control is rare, human, and non-scriptable, so a second entry point
   costs little. Against that, a hard break would force migration on
   *infrastructure* config (systemd `ExecStart=…/gmuxd run`, Dockerfiles,
   runbooks) — edited rarely, by different people, and not covered by the
   scriptable-surface migration shim. Keeping `gmuxd`'s verbs is
   backwards-compatible there and lower-risk than moving working code
   across the binary boundary. Docs steer everyone to `gmux daemon …`;
   `gmuxd --help` cross-references it. (This is *not* the `open`/`ui`/`app`
   alias smell of decision 2: that was three names for the single most
   common action; this is one canonical name plus the underlying binary
   that infra already invokes.)

7. **Daemon auto-start is intent-driven.** Session verbs (`open`, `ls`,
   `attach`, `tail`, `send`, `wait`, `kill`, `promote`, `reparent`, and `gmux -- <cmd>`)
   auto-start `gmuxd` when it is down — the daemon is a *stateful broker*
   that rehydrates dead sessions from disk, so even `ls`/`tail` on a cold
   machine have something to serve. `gmux daemon status` and bare `gmux`
   (help) never auto-start.

8. **`gmux auth` stays a distinct verb because it prints a secret.**
   Folding the token reveal into `gmux remote` status would leak live
   tokens into scrollback/screenshares on a casual status check.
   `gmux remote` shows connection *state* only and MUST NOT print the
   token; revealing the token is the explicit, deliberate act of
   `gmux auth`.

9. **Argument convention (positional vs named).**
   - A verb's single **primary operand is positional and comes first** —
     for session verbs, the session reference: `gmux kill <id>`,
     `gmux tail <id>`, `gmux attach <id>`. This deliberately diverges from
     tmux's named `-t` target: gmux is single-target with no
     `window.pane` substructure, so the disambiguation tmux needs does
     not exist, and `gmux kill foo` beats `gmux kill -t foo`.
   - **Behavior modifiers are named flags:** `-d`, `--timeout`, `--json`,
     `--no-submit`, `--all`.
   - **Variadic / verbatim content is trailing positionals**, after the
     primary operand, guarded by `--` when passed through untouched (the
     run command; literal send text).

10. **Two input verbs with distinct contracts (not aliases).**
    - `gmux send <id> <text> [Key…]` — gmux-native. `<text>` is **literal**;
      trailing bare tokens matching key names (`Enter`, `C-c`, `Escape`,
      `Up`…) are interpreted as keys. Common case: `gmux send foo 'pytest -q' Enter`.
      `--no-submit` suppresses the implicit nothing (no Enter unless a
      trailing key says so).
    - `gmux send-keys -t <id> …` — the **verbatim tmux interface**
      (`-t` target, all args are key names by default, `-l` for literal).
      A *compatibility verb*, documented as such, so tmux knowledge and
      existing tmux skills/agent calls port directly. Docs must state
      crisply: *use `send` normally; `send-keys` only when porting tmux*.
    - **Enter is explicit; `--no-submit` is removed.** Submission is
      controlled by a trailing `Enter` key token, tmux-style:
      `gmux send foo 'pytest -q' Enter` submits; omitting `Enter` types
      without submitting. This changes today's implicit-Enter default.

11. **Local-by-default, as a hard invariant (agent blast-radius).**
    The CLI's default worldview is "this host only", so an agent can
    never *accidentally* act on another machine:
    - **Targeting:** bare references resolve strictly against local
      sessions. Fuzzy/prefix matching never crosses a host boundary. A
      bare ref that matches only a peer session is a **miss with a hint**
      ("did you mean `foo@konyvtar`?"), never a silent remote action.
    - **Visibility:** `gmux ls` shows local only; `--all` opts into the
      fleet. Listing scope and targeting scope are **independent** —
      `ls --all` surfacing a remote session never lets a subsequent bare
      `gmux kill foo` reach it.
    - **Opt-in:** crossing a host requires explicitly typing `@peer`.
      This is a deliberate, per-command act; there is no flag or config
      that makes bare refs go remote.
    - This is the existing resolver behaviour (empty host = `Peer == ""`
      only); 2.0 promotes it to a tested invariant so a future refactor
      cannot quietly let prefix-matching bleed across hosts. The
      agent-facing skill keeps `@peer` as a one-line advanced escape
      hatch, not woven through its examples.
    - No regression of ADR 0005: cross-host CLI actions stay *possible*
      (gmuxd still routes via `peer.Forward`/`ProxyWS`), just *explicit*.
      The trust boundary remains the daemon + per-host pairing tokens
      (ADR 0008); the CLI is one local client among others.

12. **Guiding principle: follow tmux conventions wherever sensible.**
    tmux is the reference grammar for terminal-multiplexer agents; matching
    it (`-d` detach, `send-keys`, key names, capture semantics) lets
    existing tmux skills and agent muscle memory transfer to gmux.
    Deliberate divergences (positional target; literal-default `send`;
    no `run` verb) are called out where they occur and justified by
    gmux's narrower, session-centric model.

13a. **`gmux tail` is snapshot-only.** `gmux tail <id>` (default ~100
     lines), `-n N` for count, `--raw`/`-e` to preserve ANSI (stripped by
     default). **No `-f`/follow and no `logs` verb**: "block until output
     X" is served by a future `wait` output-condition (see decision 13);
     live human watching is served by the browser and `attach`.
     Streaming a pane elsewhere (tmux `pipe-pane`) is niche
     and deferred to a future namespace if requested.

13b. **`gmux ls` output.** Human default: short id · state
     (alive/idle/dead) · kind · slug/title · command · age (+ `peer`
     column under `--all`). `--json` emits a single stable-schema array
     (`id, slug, kind, alive, idle, pid, title, command, started_at,
     exited_at, exit_code, peer`) so agents stop scraping the table.
     tmux-style `-F`/`--format` is deferred (addable under the
     frozen-namespace policy).

>   exited_at, exit_code`; unknown values are omitted, never `null`.
>   `runner_version` is diagnostic, not capability negotiation, and binary
>   hashes stay out of this CLI projection. `parent_session_id` and
>   `socket_path` postdate this ADR.
> - The top level is `[]`, never `null`, and both renderings are alive-first,
>   newest-first with `ref` as the deterministic timestamp tie-breaker.
>   Timestamps are RFC 3339 (fractional seconds allowed); `command` is argv;

>   health, resumability, or semantic capability. Action results and stable
>   errors remain authoritative. No derived UI `state` is mirrored into the
>   list schema.

13. **`gmux wait` waits for agent idle, bounded by `--timeout`.**
    `gmux wait <id>` blocks until the session goes **idle** (agent turn
    end) or exits; `--timeout <secs>` bounds it. Exit codes were
    originally wait-specific (0 idle, 2 died, 3 timeout) and were
    replaced by ADR 0027 §8's global taxonomy: **0** the turn completed,
    **2** it was intentionally interrupted, **1** everything else (a
    failed turn, a death, a timeout, misuse). ADR 0027 §11 also makes
    the wait conditionally result-bearing. Cross-peer `wait` returns
    "not supported across peers yet" (ADR 0005 deferral).

    Output-condition variants (`--for-text` / `--for-regex` — "block
    until this text appears") were designed but initially **deferred**:
    the only sound implementation matches where the bytes are, i.e. a
    gmuxd endpoint, not client-side scrollback polling. Since
    implemented server-side
    ([#313](https://github.com/gmuxapp/gmux/issues/313)): gmuxd's wait
    handler polls the on-disk scrollback tee and matches per rendered
    (ANSI-stripped) line, so shell sessions are supported too (exit 0
    matched, 1 the session exited first or the timeout elapsed —
    originally 2 and 3, see ADR 0027 §8). Predicate waits print no
    agent result.

## Considered alternatives

- **Keep the bare shorthand `gmux <cmd>` alongside `gmux -- <cmd>`.**
  Rejected: the shorthand *freezes* the top-level namespace (every new
  verb could shadow a user's same-named binary), forecloses friendly
  "unknown verb, did you mean…?" errors, and forces a verb-vs-program
  disambiguation branch in the parser. The `gm` alias recovers the
  ergonomics without any of these costs.
- **Require `gmux run <cmd>`.** Rejected in favour of `gmux -- <cmd>`:
  `--` is universal, needs no reserved word, and the parser already
  implements it.
- **One binary for daemon + runner (symlink `gmuxd`→`gmux`).** Rejected:
  keeping `gmuxd` separate matches daemon conventions and keeps `ps`,
  systemd units, and packaging legible.

## Consequences

- ~150 lines of mutual-exclusion / interspersed-flag parsing in `cli.go`
  are removed; each verb parses its own flags normally. Only `gmux --`
  needs stop-at-first-positional.
- Verb *typos* are impossible to fool-proof only because there is no
  shorthand — every bare word is a verb, so `gmux opn` yields a clean
  "unknown command" with a suggestion.
- Breaking change appropriate to a major version. **Migration uses an
  error-only shim, not a forwarding shim.** Old forms (every removed
  flag, `gmuxd <verb>`, and the removed bare `gmux <cmd>` shorthand) are
  recognized *solely to emit a precise migration error* and exit
  nonzero — e.g. `--list` → "use `gmux ls`"; `gmuxd status` → "use
  `gmux daemon status`"; bare `gmux pytest` → "unknown command 'pytest';
  to run a command use `gmux -- pytest`". This is a static guidance
  table carrying **zero old behavior**, so the old flag parser and the
  mutual-exclusion conflict-matrix are genuinely deleted (a forwarding
  shim would have forced keeping them). The table deletes cleanly in
  2.1. Cost accepted: existing *scripts* break immediately rather than
  working-with-warning — appropriate for a major version, and agents
  migrate the instant the skill is updated. Note the shim covers the
  *scriptable* surface only; daemon/ops invocations (`gmuxd <verb>`)
  keep working unchanged per decision 6, so infrastructure config needs
  no migration.
- `--host` is dropped. `<id>@<peer>` is the **sole** way to address a
  peer session, which simplifies `matchSession` (the `host` parameter
  and the `--host`/`@suffix` reconciliation branch both go away).

## Amendment (2026-07-06): `send --wait` composes send and wait

`gmux send` gains a `--wait` behavior modifier (with `--timeout N`):
deliver the input and block until the turn it triggers completes, with
`gmux wait`'s exit codes — originally (0 idle, 2 died, 3 timeout), now
ADR 0027 §8's global 0/1/2 taxonomy, through the same mapping so an
interrupted turn cannot exit 0 here while `gmux wait` exits 2. Raw
`send --wait` prints no result.

This exists because the obvious composition `gmux send <id> … &&
gmux wait <id>` is inherently racy: `wait`'s initial snapshot can
observe the previous turn's idle state before the send-induced
`Working=true` has propagated into gmuxd's store ([#218]). The fix is
ordering — subscribe before delivering the input, then require a fresh
working→idle transition — which only one actor can guarantee, so the
two verbs must fuse for this use case. It lands as a flag, not a new
top-level verb (`send-wait` would breach decision 5), and server-side
(`POST …/input?wait=idle`), keeping idle-detection rules in gmuxd per
ADR 0005 and the `wait` design in decision 13.

Consequences for `send`'s grammar: to keep `send`'s trailing content
fully verbatim (its whole point — arbitrary text, including tokens that
start with a dash), the new flags are parsed **only before the session
ref**. The ref is the first non-flag token; everything after it is
literal, so `gmux send abc -v` still sends `-v` and no `--` guard is
needed for dash-leading text. To wait, the flag precedes the id:
`gmux send --wait abc 'do it' Enter`. A `--` before the ref is accepted
as an explicit end-of-flags marker. This applies decision 9's
verbatim-content rule (flags-then-`--`-then-verbatim, as in `gmux --
<cmd>`) rather than parsing flags amongst the content, which would have
taxed the common case with a guard. Under `--wait`, non-submitting
input (no `\r`) is rejected — it would never start a turn, so the wait
could only time out.

## Amendment (2026-07-12): `send --follow-up` / `--steering` — adapter-aware submit

> **Superseded (2026-07-26) by [ADR 0027](0027-semantic-agent-cli-and-result-bearing-wait.md):** both flags were removed before release and `gmux send` is unconditionally raw; semantic submission moves to the `gmux agent` namespace, and `adapter.PromptSubmitter` becomes `adapter.AgentActionEncoder`.

`gmux send` gains two mutually-exclusive behavior modifiers that
auto-append the session adapter's *submit* keystroke ([#385]):
`--follow-up` for the queued submit (delivered after the agent's
current turn; pi: `Alt+Enter`) and `--steering` for the immediate one
(delivered into the current turn; pi: `Enter`). This keeps submission
explicit (decision 10) while removing the need to know per-adapter key
encodings — the follow-up distinction is undiscoverable, and pi's
`Alt+Enter` (ESC CR) isn't even expressible as a `send` key token.

The mapping is an adapter capability (`adapter.PromptSubmitter`),
resolved CLI-side from the session's adapter name; adapters that don't
distinguish the modes fall back to `Enter` for both (shells; agents
like claude/codex whose `Enter` submits when idle and queues when
busy). Nothing changes on the wire — the daemon still receives raw
bytes. pi's follow-up is encoded as Kitty CSI-u Alt+Enter
(`\x1b[13;3u`) rather than legacy ESC CR, because pi parses CSI-u
under either negotiated keyboard protocol while ESC CR misparses as
shift+enter (no submit) on sessions started in the foreground of a
Kitty-protocol terminal; gmuxd's `--wait` input-must-submit guard
recognizes the CSI-u Enter alongside `\r`.

Grammar consequences: like `--wait`, the flags are recognized **only
before the session ref** (the verbatim-content rule above). Because
the flag owns submission, combining it with trailing key tokens is a
usage error — `--follow-up … Enter` would double-submit. The flags
compose with `--wait`; on pi the queued follow-up is processed within
the same agent loop before idle is reported, so `--wait --follow-up`
blocks until the queued prompt's reply, per the issue's contract.

## Amendment (2026-07-12): `tail` defaults to the conversation transcript

> **Superseded (2026-07-27) by [ADR 0027](0027-semantic-agent-cli-and-result-bearing-wait.md):** the view was right, the verb was wrong. `gmux tail` reverts to decision 13a's unconditional raw PTY view (`-n` in lines, no `--raw`/`-e`/`-r` — the flags are refused by name), and the conversation-markdown view moves to `gmux agent logs <id> [-n N]` (`-n` in messages) inside the semantic namespace. Making one verb's *output shape* depend on the session's adapter meant a script could not know what it would get without first knowing what was running; the three reading questions now have three commands. 13a's ban on a top-level `logs` verb stands — `agent logs` is namespace growth under decision 9, not a new bare verb. Server-side the transcript read (`?tail=N`) is unchanged, but its non-renderer answer is now 422 `unsupported_adapter` instead of 404 `no_conversation`, because no fallback keys on that code any more.

`gmux tail` (decision 13a) changes its default view for sessions whose
adapter persists a structured conversation file (pi's JSONL; the
adapter capability is `ConversationRenderer`): it prints clean markdown
reconstructed from that file — the actual user/assistant exchange with
compact tool-call lines — instead of the emulator-rendered PTY
scrollback, which for agent TUIs is box-drawing, spinners, and
viewport-truncated redraws ([#384]). Sessions without a renderable
conversation (shells, deleted conversations, no messages yet, adapters
without the capability) keep the PTY output, so scripts against shell
sessions see no change. The capability takes the opaque adapter-scoped
conversation ref of ADR 0022; for file adapters the ref is the
transcript's path, but that stays the adapter's private convention.

Grammar consequences, per the behavior-modifier-flag pattern (no new
verbs):

- **`--raw` forces the PTY scrollback view** — the pre-change default
  output. `-e` remains an alias. 13a described `--raw`/`-e` as
  "preserve ANSI escapes", but that had already been vestigial since
  the broker began rendering `?tail=N` through a terminal emulator
  (which strips escapes server-side); both flags' *observable*
  behavior — plain-text PTY output — is unchanged.
- **`-n` counts messages in the conversation view**, lines in the PTY
  view. One knob, unit follows the view.
- Still snapshot-only; no `-f` (13a stands). A live conversation
  stream is ADR 0021's `session/load` + `session/update` territory.

Server-side this is `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/conversation?tail=N` on
gmuxd (ADR 0005: the CLI routes through the daemon; peer sessions
forward to the owning host, where the conversation lives). The
endpoint answers 404 `no_conversation` when there is nothing to
render, which is the CLI's signal to fall back to scrollback — also
the path taken against older daemons that lack the endpoint entirely.
The daemon stays content-free (ADR 0011): the adapter re-reads the
stored conversation per request; nothing is cached or stored.

## Amendment (2026-07-06): `edit` joins the top-level namespace

`gmux edit [file]` is added as a top-level verb. It cannot live under a
namespace group because its primary use is `EDITOR="gmux edit"` — the
string a third-party program execs must be a single terse invocation.

This amends decision 5's "adding a new top-level verb is a breaking
change requiring a major bump" in practice: the namespace remains
*deliberately small and closed to casual growth*, but first-class
session/tab types (of which the editor is the first; more are expected)
warrant top-level verbs when the verb is itself an external interface
contract like `$EDITOR`. Each such addition still requires an explicit
amendment here.

## Amendment (2026-07-26): `agent` is a namespace group

`gmux agent prompt|cancel|output` (ADR 0027) is added as a **namespace
group**, which is exactly the growth path decision 5 prescribes ("future
groups (e.g. `gmux peer …`) as needed") — not a new top-level verb, so
the frozen-verb rule is untouched: `agent` alone is a usage error, and
every capability lives behind a sub-verb.

It is also the first group whose sub-verbs take flags, so `gmux help
agent [verb]` (and `--help` on any of them) prints per-verb help. That
narrows decision 9's "per-verb help is intentionally not implemented"
to the flagless verbs it was written for; the generic `gmux help <verb>`
remains lenient and prints the full usage for everything else.

`send` stays raw and adapter-blind (its semantic `--steering`/
`--follow-up` flags are gone); intent-carrying submission is `agent`'s
job. The two are permanently separate surfaces, not layers of one.

## Amendment (2026-08-17): session-operation criterion

Decision 5 now uses the session-operation criterion above rather than a frozen
list. This supersedes earlier “closed namespace” wording and the unreleased
`session` group/read command. `promote` and `reparent` are top-level because
they operate on one addressed session and share the normal local-only,
auto-start, and exit-code contracts. `agent` remains a namespace because it is
a semantic-agent domain, not a generic session mutation.
