// SweepDeadSessions marks, in one durable transaction, every candidate row
// whose runner did not come back during the startup convergence window:
//
//   - ExitedAt is synthesized from the sweep time (the dead-generation
//     contract: every dead row carries an explicit exit timestamp);
//   - ExitCode stays NULL — the daemon never observed the exit;
//   - active/unread/error are preserved: the turn state at death is the
//     wait verdict and must not depend on how death was detected;
//   - last activity bumps on the alive→dead transition and never moves
//     backwards.
//
// The only per-row predicate is `exited_at_ms IS NULL`: a candidate whose
// exit was recorded meanwhile, or whose row disappeared, is silently
// skipped. There is deliberately NO row-version predicate — the row version
// can churn during the window without resolving liveness (a dead-row
// acknowledgement bumps it; a re-registration with changed facts bumps it
// and the runner may still vanish without exit facts afterwards), and a
// version fence would let such rows escape the one-shot sweep forever
// without an exit timestamp. Concurrent-registration safety is therefore
// entirely the caller's obligation: the lifecycle coordinator must hold its
// mutex across candidate selection and this call, and must exclude every
// row with a currently installed live generation.
//
// The whole sweep commits as one transaction and reports one invalidation.
