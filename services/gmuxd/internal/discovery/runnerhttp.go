// runnerhttp.go — HTTP-over-AF_UNIX helper for talking to runners.
//
// gmuxd talks to each runner over a per-session Unix socket using
// HTTP. Every call site here is short: a single request and
// response, then done. AF_UNIX dials cost ~10 µs of kernel work
// (no network round-trip to amortize), so connection pooling earns
// almost nothing while introducing a lifecycle (idle pool, drain,
// orphan-conn races) that has to be reasoned about and tested.
//
// One helper, runnerRequest. Each call dials, requests, closes.
// req.Close = true tells the transport to close the underlying FD
// when the response body is closed instead of returning it to the
// idle pool, so a per-call transport has nothing to leak when it
// goes out of scope.
//
// This file exists because three call sites previously open-coded
// the same &http.Transport{DialContext: unix-dial} closure and
// discarded the transport after each request. Closing the response
// body returned the connection to the abandoned transport's idle
// pool instead of closing the FD; on a busy daemon this exhausted
// RLIMIT_NOFILE within hours. See #197.

// runnerRequest issues a single HTTP request to the runner at

// urlPath is the path portion only (e.g. "/meta"); the host is
// fixed because the transport dials socketPath unconditionally.
// The caller is responsible for closing resp.Body. ctx bounds the
// request lifetime; the runner timeout (3 s) is applied via
// http.Client.Timeout, which composes with a tighter caller ctx
// (earlier deadline wins) and cancels its internal timer when the
// body is closed. body may be nil for parameterless GET / POST.

// The 3 s client timeout is right for the short control calls (/meta, /kill,
// /input) and wrong for the semantic action routes: the runner legitimately
// blocks there for the adapter's readiness timeout (10 s for pi) and, on a
// PTY the agent is not reading, for longer still. Cutting such a call off at
// 3 s would convert a legitimate slow admission into a transport error whose
// delivery is indeterminate — the worst possible answer, since it forbids a
// safe retry. Callers of this helper must impose their own deadline via ctx.
