// Package central composes full snapshot payloads from the authoritative
// central store (ADR 0026). It is the nonproduction, query-backed successor
// to the store.Store-fed composition in internal/snapshot:
//
//   - every composition pass reads all requested payload inputs from ONE
//     SQLite read transaction (centralstore.ReadSnapshot), so a cross-kind
//     mutation can never yield a torn sessions/projects pair;
//   - invalidation is level-triggered and coalesced: commits mark kinds
//     dirty, one composer goroutine emits at most one in-flight composition,
//     and dirt arriving during a pass triggers another pass — no missed
//     updates, no unbounded queue;
//   - runner-live facts (alive, PID, endpoint, runner version/hash) are
//     overlaid from a point-in-time runtime view, never read from SQLite.
//
// The payload types mirror what the production SSE snapshot needs but are
// intentionally this package's own: conversion to the exact wire shape (and
// the peer-projection merge) happens at the production cutover.
