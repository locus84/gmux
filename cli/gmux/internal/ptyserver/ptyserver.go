//  1. Take the lease (waiting briefly if the reaper holds it).

// The turn events are result-bearing (ADR 0027, 2026-07-28 amendment): a
// result-bearing adapter asserts its own turn boundary and delivers the turn's
// outcome, final assistant prose and user-bounded activity span. The runner relays
// those facts in its turn frame (session.TurnFrame) and never reconstructs them
// from the conversation.
//
// Outcome is a stable, agent-agnostic vocabulary ("completed" | "interrupted" |
// "error"); each agent's hook normalizes its own terminal state into it, and
// the runner owns what each means for the sidebar (see applyTurnEnd). The full
// wire contract is documented in docs/runner-hook-protocol.md. pi's hook
// (pi-ext.mjs) is the reference implementation.

// applyTurnEnd maps a normalized turn outcome to sidebar state. This is the
// one place gmux decides what an agent's terminal state means:
//
//	completed   — the agent finished on its own; the reply is unread.
//	error       — the agent gave up (e.g. exhausted retries); show a red dot.
//	interrupted — a human or agent intentionally stopped the turn: idle,
//	              nothing unread, but recorded so a synchronous wait can
//	              report the stop instead of a completion or a failure.
//
// SetStatus replaces the status wholesale, so a terminal outcome clears the
// previous turn's interruption exactly like a "turn" start does.
//
// A terminal end only closes an OPEN turn (State.CloseTurnFrame, atomic under the
// state lock). The runner owns turn open/closed state, so an end against an
// already-closed turn is stale — and now that interruption is durable,
// applying it would rewrite a good closure. Claude is the concrete case: a
// clean turn is UserPromptSubmit → Stop → SessionEnd, and SessionEnd (which
// covers exiting mid-turn, where neither Stop nor StopFailure fires) would
// otherwise overwrite the Stop/StopFailure closure with an interruption on
// every normal session exit. The
// hook translator cannot dedupe it: each event is a fresh, stateless
// `gmux __claude-hook` process (ADR 0015), so the runner — the one component
// holding turn state — is the right boundary. Repeated ends become idempotent
// for every agent.
//
// LIMIT, stated explicitly: this is turn POLARITY, not turn IDENTITY. Without
// a turn token the runner cannot tell a logically stale end (end₁ arriving
// after start₂) from a legitimate end of turn 2, so such an end would close
// the new turn. Excluding that ordering is the sender's responsibility, and
// how completely it is excluded differs per agent:
//
//   - pi: guaranteed. The extension serializes hook delivery on one promise
//     chain, so request N+1 is never issued before N settles
//     (cli/gmux/internal/agentext/pi-ext.mjs).
//   - Claude: partial. `Stop` hooks are awaited, so a clean turn's end lands
//     before whatever follows. `StopFailure`'s output and exit code are
//     documented as ignored, so it is not evidently awaited: a session exiting
//     at almost the same moment could deliver `SessionEnd` first and record an
//     API-failed turn as interrupted instead of error. Narrow, accepted here.
//
// A turn token/generation is the durable fix for an agent that cannot
// guarantee ordering; it is deliberately not introduced here.
//
// The title refresh is not turn state and is applied either way: a late end
// carrying a fresher title (Claude's Stop refresh, pi's session name) should
// still land.
// The asserted result travels with the close as ONE event carrying both the
// settled frame and the terminal status (State.CloseTurnFrame), so no subscriber
// can observe the close without the result that closed it — not by reordering,
// and not by the lossy fan-out dropping one of two sends. An adapter that asserts
// no turn identity (Claude, Codex, a raw `PUT /status` child) leaves TurnSeq 0,
// which no waiter can match, so those closes are served result-free instead of
