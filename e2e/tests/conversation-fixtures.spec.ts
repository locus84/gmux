/**
 * Smoke spec: pre-seeded fixtures (written by global-setup before gmuxd
 * starts) must be reachable at /v1/conversations/{adapter}/{slug} once the
 * bootstrap scan completes.
 *
 * Purpose: detect drift between the TS fixtures in `e2e/fixtures.ts`
 * and the Go parsers in `packages/adapter/adapters/*.go`. If a parser
 * grows a new required field and the TS fixture doesn't update, this
 * spec fails first with a clear signal pointing at fixture validity,
 * before the discovery spec's tests run.
 *
 * The tests assert via the public API only (no introspection). The
 * polling timeout is generous because we only need the bootstrap scan
 * to have completed once at startup; in practice it's done before the
 * first test even runs.
