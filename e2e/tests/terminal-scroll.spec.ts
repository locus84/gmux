 * Reproduces the long-standing "scrollback jumps to the top" bug that's

 * end-of-turn redraws.
 *
 * These tests bypass the WebSocket and inject pre-built frames through the
 * exact same code path as ws.onmessage (terminal-io's enqueue), via the
 * test-only `window.__gmuxInject(b64)` hook installed by terminal.tsx.
 * That tests the real xterm.js + terminal-io + replay interaction with
 * deterministic byte sequences and frame boundaries — which is where the
 * synthetic scroll harness in terminal-io.test.ts cannot reach.
 *
 * Frame boundaries matter: each call to __gmuxInject is one logical WS
 * message, so splitting BSU/content/ESU across multiple inject calls
 * exercises the same paths a real WS message stream does.

   * 0 mid-parse; the long redraw appends lines but `ydisp` does not

   * `scrollToLine(min(0, baseY)) = 0` and the user landed at the top
   * of the rerendered conversation. Verified end-to-end: this test
   * fails on the pre-fix code with `viewportY=0, distance=baseY`
   * (see PR #203 for the on-`main` CI run that produced exactly
   * that diagnostic).

   * Trigger condition is just "user not at bottom when the frame

   * observations confirmed the bug fires on a passive viewer too.
   *
   * Contract pinned here: byte-presence of `\x1b[3J` in the BSU/ESU
   * block triggers distance-from-bottom restoration regardless of
