description: How gmux is shipped — binaries, packaging, and deployment modes.

:::note[Design record]
This is the design/ops record for how gmux ships. Most of it is in place today (goreleaser releases with checksums, the Homebrew tap, `install.sh`, automatic daemon upgrade). Items still open are called out inline; anything not marked is shipped.
:::

## Artifacts

### Native binaries

- **`gmuxd`** — machine daemon (discovery, proxy, embedded web UI)
- **`gmux`** — session runner (PTY, adapters, Unix socket server)

Both ship as platform-specific binaries with checksums. The web UI is compiled into `gmuxd` via `go:embed` — no separate web server needed.

### Deployment modes

**Local (default):** One command starts gmuxd + gmux on your machine. The web UI is served by gmuxd at `localhost:8790`. This is how most people will use gmux.

**Remote via tailscale:** gmuxd optionally joins your tailnet for HTTPS access from other devices. See [Remote Access](/remote-access).
