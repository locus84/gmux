description: See sessions from every dev container alongside your local sessions.
---

Add one line to your `devcontainer.json` and every session inside the container appears in your gmux dashboard automatically. No port forwarding, no token copying, no manual configuration.

## Setup

Add the gmux [devcontainer Feature](https://github.com/gmuxapp/features):

```json
{
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:debian",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/gmuxapp/features/gmux": {}
  }
}
```

That's it. Rebuild the container and any `gmux` session you start inside it shows up in your host's dashboard within seconds.

## How it works

The feature installs `gmux` and `gmuxd` into the container and starts the daemon automatically. The host gmuxd discovers the container through Docker events:

1. Container starts with `GMUXD_LISTEN=0.0.0.0` in its environment (set by the feature) and the `devcontainer.local_folder` label (set automatically by the devcontainer CLI / VS Code). Both are required — containers launched outside a devcontainer tool are not discovered.
2. Host gmuxd detects the start event and reads the container's auth token via `docker exec` (retried for slow-starting containers)
3. Host connects to the container's gmuxd over the Docker bridge network
4. Container sessions stream into the host dashboard via the standard peer protocol

The container's sessions appear in the sidebar with a container icon; on the CLI they are addressed as `<id>@<peer>` (the peer is named after the host folder, e.g. `my-project`). Discovered containers also show up in **Settings → Hosts** with `Source: devcontainer`.

When the container stops, its sessions disappear from the dashboard. When it starts again, the host re-discovers it and the sessions come back — conversation history lives inside the container, so nothing is lost.

:::note[Version compatibility]
Host and container must run the same major gmux version. After updating the host, rebuild your devcontainers so the feature installs a matching gmux.

## Pre-provisioned auth token

By default, a random token is generated on first container start. If you need a known token (for scripting or health checks), set `GMUXD_TOKEN`:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/gmuxapp/features/gmux": {}
  },
  "containerEnv": {
    "GMUXD_TOKEN": "output-of-openssl-rand-hex-32"
  }
}
```

The token must be at least 64 hex characters. See [Environment variables](/reference/environment/#auth-token) for the full lifecycle.

:::note
With auto-discovery, you rarely need a pre-provisioned token. The host reads it from the container automatically.
:::

## Disabling auto-discovery

Devcontainer discovery is on by default. To keep containers from being auto-discovered (e.g. if you want to manage them as manual peers):

```toml
# ~/.config/gmux/host.toml
[discovery]
devcontainers = false
```

## Standalone container access

If you're running a container without host-side gmux (e.g. a remote server), add `forwardPorts` to access the container's UI directly:

```json
{
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/gmuxapp/features/gmux": {}
  },
  "forwardPorts": [8790],
  "portsAttributes": {
    "8790": { "label": "gmux", "onAutoForward": "silent" }
  }
}
```

Then open the forwarded port and authenticate with `docker exec <container> gmux auth`.

For standalone Docker deployments without devcontainers, see [Running in Docker](/running-in-docker).
