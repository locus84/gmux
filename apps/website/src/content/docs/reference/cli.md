## Overview

**`gmux`** — the command you use. It runs commands in managed sessions and
drives them (list, attach, tail, send, wait, kill), plus daemon control and
pairing. It auto-starts the daemon when needed.

**`gmuxd`** — the daemon process. Serves the web UI, session history, and
optional remote access. You rarely invoke it directly; `gmux` starts it for
you, and `gmux daemon …` controls it.

`gmux` is verb-first: `gmux <verb> [args]`. Running a command is the one form
that isn't a verb — it uses an explicit `--` separator so gmux never has to
guess where its flags end and your command begins.

## Running a command

### `gmux -- <command> [args...]`

Run a command inside a gmux session. Everything after `--` is your command,
verbatim — including its own flags. The session registers with gmuxd and
appears in the web UI.

```bash
gmux -- bash
gmux -- python3 main.py
gmux -- pi "build the feature"
gmux -- pytest --watch        # --watch belongs to pytest, not gmux
```

There's no bare shorthand: `gmux pytest` is an "unknown command" error (gmux
suggests the `gmux -- pytest` form). If you run commands constantly,
`alias gm='gmux --'` gives you `gm pytest` back.

Behavior depends on whether stdin is a terminal and whether you're already
inside a gmux session:

| Stdin              | Inside `GMUX=1`? | Behavior                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TTY                | no               | Attach: wire your terminal to the child PTY, forward Ctrl-C and resize, detach when the terminal closes. |
| TTY                | yes              | Auto-detach: spawn the session in the background and return immediately, so PTYs don't nest.            |
| Pipe / file / null | either           | Block, stream bounded metadata to stdout, exit with the child's exit code. The session keeps running for the UI to attach to. |

The pipe/file/null row is the canonical shape for scripts and agent harnesses:
a blocking call, bounded stdout (no full PTY noise in your logs), and reliable
exit-code propagation — so `if gmux -- pytest -q; then …` works.

See [Scripts and agents](/integrations/scripts-and-agents/) for the narrative
version with a worked build-and-report example.

### `gmux -d -- <command> [args...]`

Detached run. Spawns the session in the background and prints its session id on
stdout, so a script can capture it (`id=$(gmux -d -- pi "…")`) and drive it
without polling. `-d` must come before `--`.

## Managing sessions

Sessions are **local by default**: a bare id only ever matches a session on
this machine, so you can't accidentally act on another host. To target a peer,
suffix the id with `@<peer>` (see `gmux ls --all`). IDs are the 8-character
short form the UI shows; verbs also accept a unique id prefix, the full id, or
the session's slug.

### `gmux ls`

List sessions, alive first, newest first. Local only unless `--all`.

```
$ gmux ls
ID        STATUS  KIND   TITLE
a3f20187  alive   pi     fix auth bug  (/home/mg/dev/myapp)
be14b052  alive   shell  bash          (/home/mg/dev/gmux)
7d3304e9  dead    shell  make build    (/home/mg/dev/myapp)
```

- `--all` — include sessions from every connected peer (adds a peer column).
- `--json` — emit a JSON array instead of the table, for scripts and agents.

### `gmux attach <id>`

Reattach your local terminal to a session. Scrollback is replayed on connect,
SIGWINCH is forwarded, and closing the terminal detaches without killing the
session. Requires an interactive terminal. Peer sessions work transparently —
gmuxd proxies the WebSocket to the owning host.

```bash
gmux attach a3f20187
gmux attach fix-auth-bug      # slug also works
gmux attach a3f20187@desktop  # a session on a peer
```

### `gmux tail <id>`

Print recent output as plain text. ANSI escapes are stripped by default so the
output is grep-friendly.

```bash
gmux tail a3f20187            # last 100 lines (default)
gmux tail -n 500 a3f20187     # last 500 lines
gmux tail --raw a3f20187      # keep ANSI escapes (-e also works)
```

It's a snapshot, not a stream — to watch a session live, attach to it or open
it in the browser.

### `gmux send <id> [text] [Key...]`

Inject input into a running session as if typed at the keyboard. The text is
sent literally; any trailing arguments that name keys (`Enter`, `C-c`,
`Escape`, `Up`, …) are sent as those keys. **Submission is explicit** — add a
trailing `Enter` to dispatch a line; omit it to leave the input unsent.

```bash
gmux send a3f20187 'describe yourself' Enter   # type and submit
gmux send a3f20187 'half a thought'            # type, leave it unsent
gmux send a3f20187 C-c                          # interrupt (Ctrl-C)
gmux send a3f20187 Escape                       # send Escape
echo "$body" | gmux send a3f20187 Enter         # pipe stdin, then submit
```

When no text is given and stdin is a pipe, gmux reads stdin until EOF (capped
at 1 MiB) and sends it — the natural shape for files and heredocs. Include a
trailing `Enter` to submit piped input.

For verbatim tmux compatibility there's also `gmux send-keys -t <id> <keys...>`
(all arguments are key names by default; `-l` sends them as literal text).
Use plain `send` for everyday use; `send-keys` only when porting tmux commands.

**Access control.** `send` is powerful — anything you send lands in the
session's PTY, indistinguishable from keyboard input. Access is gated by
filesystem permissions on the session's Unix socket (owner-only), so only the
user who started a session can send to it. Peer sessions are reached through
gmuxd's authenticated proxy.

### `gmux wait <id>`

Block until an **agent** session finishes its current turn (its spinner stops),
optionally bounded by `--timeout N`.

```bash
gmux send a3f20187 'do the thing' Enter
gmux wait a3f20187
gmux wait a3f20187 --timeout 600   # or fail after 600s
```

The idle signal is the same `Status.Working` flag the UI's spinner consumes,
so `wait` returns the moment the agent emits its closing message. Exit codes
(so scripts can branch on the outcome):

- `0` — the agent reached idle
- `2` — the session exited before becoming idle
- `3` — `--timeout` elapsed

Plain **shell** sessions have no idle signal and are rejected with a clear
error; to wait for a shell command, run it through the blocking piped form
(`gmux -- make build < /dev/null`) instead. Idle wait is local-only for now
(peer support is pending). Waiting on arbitrary output ("until this text
appears") is planned as a server-side `wait` condition
([#313](https://github.com/gmuxapp/gmux/issues/313)).

### `gmux kill <id>`

Terminate a running session: `SIGTERM` to the child, normal exit lifecycle,
session marked dead — the same path as the UI's kill button.

```bash
gmux kill a3f20187
```

## Git worktrees

Worktree commands are local-only. They read Git metadata on this machine and
never interpret a peer session's filesystem path locally.

### `gmux worktree current`

Show the worktree containing the current directory. `--json` emits its path,
branch, HEAD, and Git state as an object.

### `gmux worktree ps [selector]`

List checkouts in the current repository and group their live local gmux
sessions by actual cwd. Use `--json` for automation. Select one checkout with
`current`, `branch:<branch>`, `path:<path>`, `name:<directory>`, or a unique bare
branch/path/name.

```bash
gmux worktree ps
gmux worktree ps branch:fix/login --json
```

### `gmux worktree create <name>`

Create a new branch and linked worktree, optionally launching a registered gmux
agent there and typing its initial prompt.

```bash
gmux worktree create fix-login \
  --base origin/main \
  --agent pi \
  --prompt "Implement the login fix and run focused tests" \
  --json
```

Options:

- `--repo PATH` — source repository; defaults to the current checkout.
- `--base REF` — creation ref; defaults to `HEAD`.
- `--path PATH` — destination; defaults to the mirrored canonical repository path under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/gmux/worktrees` (normally `~/.local/share/gmux/worktrees`). Branch slashes become dashes in the final directory name.
- `--agent LAUNCHER` — an available gmux launcher such as `pi`, `claude`, or `codex`.
- `--prompt TEXT` — initial PTY input; requires `--agent`.
- `--json` — emit the created worktree and optional session id.

For example, repository `/Users/me/src/app` and branch `fix/login` produce
`~/.local/share/gmux/worktrees/Users/me/src/app/fix-login` by default.

Existing branches and paths are rejected. If agent startup or prompt delivery
fails, gmux preserves the checkout and reports its path; a lost daemon response
may be ambiguous, so inspect `gmux ls` before relaunching. There is intentionally
no worktree removal command yet—review and integrate work before cleaning it up
with Git.

## UI, pairing, and the daemon

### `gmux open`

Open the gmux UI in a browser, starting gmuxd if needed. Prefers Chrome/Chromium
in app mode for a standalone window; falls back to the default browser. (Bare
`gmux` with no arguments prints help — use `gmux open` to launch the UI.)

### `gmux auth`

Print this host's login URL and token, plus a connect URL and QR code for
pairing another machine. This reveals a secret — run it deliberately, not as a
status check.

### `gmux remote`

Set up or check Tailscale remote access. Walks you through enabling it the
first time, then reports connection status on later runs. See
[Remote Access](/remote-access/). (Shows connection *state* only; it never
prints the token — use `gmux auth` for that.)

### `gmux daemon <command>`

Control the daemon process. This is the canonical front for daemon lifecycle;
the underlying `gmuxd` binary keeps the same verbs for service managers.

```bash
gmux daemon status     # health, session counts, peer status
gmux daemon start      # start in the background (replaces a running instance)
gmux daemon stop       # stop the running daemon
gmux daemon restart    # restart; active sessions survive and are rediscovered
gmux daemon log-path   # print the log file path (for scripting)
```

`gmux daemon status` example:

```
gmuxd 2.0.0 (ready)
  tcp:    127.0.0.1:8790
  socket: /home/user/.local/state/gmux/gmuxd.sock
  remote: https://gmux.tailnet.ts.net

Sessions: 3 alive (2 local, 1 remote), 12 dead (15 total)

Peers:
  • desktop (1 session)        https://gmux-desktop.tailnet.ts.net
  ○ gmux-server (offline)      https://gmux-server.tailnet.ts.net
  ✗ manual-peer (refused)      https://peer.example.com
```

### `gmux version` · `gmux help`

Print the version, or the usage summary. `gmux help` accepts a trailing verb
name (it prints the full usage either way).

## gmuxd

The daemon process. You normally start and control it through `gmux` (which
auto-starts it) and `gmux daemon …`. Invoke `gmuxd` directly only when a service
manager needs to own the process:

```bash
gmuxd          # run in the foreground (for systemd, Docker, debugging)
gmuxd run      # same thing, explicit
```

Foreground `gmuxd` reads [`host.toml`](/reference/host-toml/), binds
`127.0.0.1` on the configured port (default 8790), and creates a Unix socket
for local IPC. For background start/stop/status/restart and the log path, use
`gmux daemon …` above. `gmuxd --help` lists the binary's own verbs and points
back to the `gmux daemon` equivalents.
