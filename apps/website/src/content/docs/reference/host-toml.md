`~/.config/gmux/host.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gmux/host.toml`)

Daemon behavior. gmuxd reads this file once at startup. Create or edit it manually. The only command that modifies this file is `gmux remote`, which can add the `[tailscale]` section with your confirmation. If the file does not exist, safe defaults are used. Changes require restarting gmuxd.

## Example

```toml
# TCP port for the HTTP listener.
# Default: 8790
port = 8790

# Optional: serve web assets from a local build directory instead of the
# frontend embedded in gmuxd. Useful for web-only local installs.
# web_dir = "~/.local/state/gmux/web"

# Optional Tailscale remote access.
# See the Remote Access guide for setup.
[tailscale]
enabled = false
allow = []               # additional login names (owner is auto-whitelisted)

# Auto-discover devcontainer peers. Defaults to true.
[discovery]
devcontainers = true     # subscribe to Docker events, register gmux containers
```

## Node identity

This host's name — what peers see in their UI and URLs — is **not** configured here. When Tailscale is enabled the name is your Tailscale machine name (owned and kept stable by Tailscale itself); otherwise it is the OS hostname. The first time the daemon joins a tailnet it requests `gmux-<hostname>`, and Tailscale keeps that name across restarts and container recreation. See [ADR 0007](https://github.com/gmuxapp/gmux/blob/main/docs/adr/0007-host-identity-and-peer-urls.md).

To seed a specific name at first registration — e.g. when running several daemons on one machine — set the `GMUXD_TS_HOSTNAME` environment variable (used verbatim). It only applies before the node is registered; afterward Tailscale owns the name.

## Connecting to other hosts

There is **no `[[peers]]` config**. Add a host you want to aggregate sessions from at runtime via **Settings → Hosts → Connect to host** (paste the connect URL from `gmux auth`, or enter the host's URL and token). A token is required for every host, tailnet or not ([ADR 0008](https://github.com/gmuxapp/gmux/blob/main/docs/adr/0008-peer-authentication-via-token.md)). Connected hosts are saved to `peers.json` in the state directory, and the peer's name is taken from the host itself — you don't assign one.

## Fields

### Top-level

| Field | Type | Default | Range | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `port` | `number` | `8790` | 1–65535 | TCP port for the HTTP listener. |
| `web_dir` | `string` | *(embedded frontend)* | local directory containing `index.html` | Serve web assets from a local build directory instead of the embedded bundle. `~` is supported. Overridden by `GMUXD_WEB_DIR`, and ignored when `GMUXD_DEV_PROXY` is set. |

### `[tailscale]`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable Tailscale remote access. |
| `allow` | `string[]` | `[]` | Additional Tailscale login names to allow (owner is auto-whitelisted). Each must contain `@`. |

### `[discovery]`

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `devcontainers` | `boolean` | `true` | Subscribe to Docker events and register any container with the gmux devcontainer feature **and** the `devcontainer.local_folder` label as a peer. Skipped if the Docker CLI is not installed. |

There is no `tailscale` discovery flag (removed in [ADR 0008](https://github.com/gmuxapp/gmux/blob/main/docs/adr/0008-peer-authentication-via-token.md)). Tailnet autodiscovery was removed because auto-connecting peers without a token let a single compromised node drive the whole tailnet; add tailnet hosts manually via **Connect to host**.

## Strict validation

The config file is strictly validated at startup. gmuxd refuses to start if:

- **Unknown keys** are present, catching typos like `alow` instead of `allow`
- **`allow` entries don't contain `@`**, likely not a valid Tailscale login name
- **`port` is out of range** (must be 1–65535)
- **TOML syntax is invalid**

This is intentional. Silent fallback to defaults is dangerous for security settings. See [Security](/security) for the reasoning.

Two keys were **removed** in ADR 0007 and are now **ignored with a deprecation warning** (rather than failing startup), so upgrading a host that still has an old config doesn't brick the daemon. Remove them to silence the warning:

- **`tailscale.hostname`** — the node name now comes from Tailscale / the OS hostname.
- **`[[peers]]`** — manual peers are runtime state; add them via *Connect to host* (stored in `peers.json`).
