description: How gmux works with the pi coding agent.
---

gmux has built-in support for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). No configuration is needed — launch pi through gmux and everything works automatically.

## What you get

### Live status

The sidebar shows when pi is actively working. gmux loads a small extension into pi at launch which reports each turn boundary, so the agent shows as **active** (pulsing cyan dot) while it is processing and clears when the turn completes — no PTY scraping or log parsing.

### Session titles from conversations

Instead of showing "pi" for every session, the extension reports pi's session name — which pi auto-generates from the conversation (and you can change with pi's `/name` command):

```
▼ ~/dev/myapp
  ● Fix the auth bug in login.go
  ● Add pagination to the API
  ○ Refactor database layer
```

Renaming with pi's `/name` command updates the sidebar live.

### Resumable sessions

When a pi session exits, it remains in the sidebar as a resumable entry. Click it to resume exactly where you left off — gmux launches `pi --session <path> -c` with the right conversation file.

Resumable sessions are deduplicated: if you're already running a session that matches a resumable entry, only the live one appears.

### Launch from the UI

Pi appears in the launch menu only when it is available on the current machine. `gmuxd` checks this at startup by looking for a `pi` binary on `PATH`; if none is found, the pi launcher is omitted from the UI. (Restart the daemon after installing pi.)

## How it works

### Detection

There are two separate pi checks:

- **availability discovery** in `gmuxd`: look up `pi` on `PATH` at daemon startup to decide whether the pi launcher should be shown
- **runtime matching** in `gmux`: scan the launched command for a `pi` or `pi-coding-agent` binary name

The runtime matching works with direct invocation, full paths, `npx`, `nix run`, and other wrappers:

```bash
gmux -- pi                           # ✓ matched
gmux -- /home/user/.local/bin/pi     # ✓ matched
gmux -- npx pi                       # ✓ matched
gmux -- pi update                    # ✓ matched, but runs directly (passthrough)
gmux -- echo "not pi"                # ✗ not matched
```

Detection is validated: `GMUX_ADAPTER=pi` only takes effect if the command actually invokes a `pi` / `pi-coding-agent` binary, so it can't force the pi adapter onto an arbitrary wrapper script. If you wrap pi, keep the binary name visible in the command (e.g. `gmux -- env FOO=1 pi`), or name your wrapper `pi`/`pi-coding-agent`.

### Session files

Pi stores conversations as JSONL files in `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`. Each working directory gets its own subfolder with an encoded name:

```
~/.pi/agent/sessions/
  --home-mg-dev-myapp--/
    2026-03-15T10-00-00-000Z_abc123.jsonl
    2026-03-15T11-30-00-000Z_def456.jsonl
```

gmuxd watches this directory to keep its conversation index (URL resolution and search) current and to notice when a conversation file is deleted — a deleted conversation lets gmux retire the corresponding dead session. Watching never creates sidebar sessions on its own. gmux honors pi's own `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` override: if you point pi at an isolated data directory, gmux looks for conversations under `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/sessions`. Live session state — attribution, title, and status — comes from the extension, not from parsing these files. The first line of each file is a session header with a UUID and timestamp.

### The gmux extension

When gmux owns the launch, it injects the gmux session extension into pi (`pi -e <materialized-extension>`; extensions accumulate, so it coexists with your own). The extension subscribes to pi's own lifecycle and reports state to the runner authoritatively — no inference:

- **`session_start`** (fires on startup *and* on every `/new`, `/resume`, and `/fork`) reports the active conversation file, id, and name. This is what binds a session to its file, and it's the only signal that survives selecting an already-loaded session from pi's `/resume` picker — pi serves that from memory without touching disk, so there is nothing for an external heuristic to observe. (This replaces the old scrollback content-matching; see ADR 0011.)
- **`agent_start` / `agent_settled`** bound each span of work (pi may emit several `agent_end`s per run when it retries; `agent_settled` fires exactly once), so gmux drives status without watching the file. Each completed assistant response is also reported as an **iteration**, which is what `gmux wait` and `gmux agent logs` count in their exchange reports.

### Status

The extension reports each turn with a normalized, agent-agnostic outcome; gmux maps it to the sidebar:

- **turn start** → active (pulsing cyan dot)
- **completed** → idle, marked unread
- **interrupted** (pi's `aborted` stop reason — you pressed Esc) → idle, recorded as an intentional stop: no "finished" notification, and a synchronous wait reports the stop rather than a completion
- **error** (pi exhausted its auto-retries, or the turn was cut off by a length/tool-use limit) → red dot; clears when you view the session or send a new message

### Disabling the extension

If a pi release ever breaks the extension, set `GMUX_NO_AGENT_HOOK=1` to launch pi without it. Pi runs normally; gmux just won't show hook-driven title/status/attribution until you unset it (or a fix ships). For sessions launched from the web UI or resumed by the daemon, set the variable in the daemon's environment (it's read by the runner, which the daemon spawns).

One-shot pi commands are never extended or wrapped in a session — gmux execs them directly: the subcommands `auth`, `install`, `remove`, `uninstall`, `update`, `list`, `config` (immediately after the binary) and the info flags `--help`/`-h`/`--version`.

## Limitations

- **Title appears after the first turn.** While the first turn is running, the session shows a generic title. Once the turn ends, gmux titles it with your first message; when pi generates or you set a session name, that name takes over.
- **The extension only loads when gmux controls the launch.** A shell-wrapped invocation (e.g. `bash -lc "pi …"`) doesn't receive the `-e` flag, so that session won't report hook-driven state.
