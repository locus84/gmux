description: Adapter for the OpenCode AI coding agent.

:::note[Not implemented]
The original blocker (project management) shipped in 2.0. The mechanism sketched below predates the current architecture: discovery would now be an adapter-owned [`ConversationSource`](/develop/writing-adapters/#conversationsource) (ADR 0014), and live status should come from an [agent hook](/develop/adapter-architecture/#live-session-state-comes-from-the-agent-hook) (ADR 0013/0015) rather than DB polling.

[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) is an open-source AI coding agent that runs in the terminal. Unlike Claude Code, pi, and Codex (which write JSONL conversation files to central directories), OpenCode stores sessions in a SQLite database at `.opencode/opencode.db` relative to the working directory. This per-project storage model is why the adapter needs an adapter-owned conversation source to discover sessions.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Basic adapter

Implement the core `Adapter` and `Launchable` interfaces.

- **Name**: `opencode`
- **Binary**: `opencode`
- **Match**: scan command args for `opencode` (same pattern as claude/codex)
- **Discover**: `exec.LookPath("opencode")`
- **Turn state**: no PTY parsing (OpenCode's animated bubbletea TUI makes byte inference unreliable); until a hook exists, sessions run the runner's default turn model.
- **Launcher**: `{ id: "opencode", label: "OpenCode", command: ["opencode"], description: "Coding Agent" }`

This is enough for sessions to appear in gmux and be launchable from the UI. No working/idle status, no session discovery, no resume.

### Phase 2: Session discovery via SQLite

The adapter's `ConversationSource` checks each configured project directory for `.opencode/opencode.db` and queries it for sessions.

OpenCode's SQLite schema stores sessions and messages in two tables:

```sql
-- sessions table
id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
title TEXT NOT NULL,
message_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- Unix ms
created_at INTEGER NOT NULL   -- Unix ms

-- messages table
id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
role TEXT NOT NULL,
parts TEXT NOT NULL default '[]',  -- JSON array
finished_at INTEGER
```

The adapter would implement `ConversationDescriber` (with the session row's `id` as the opaque conversation ref — ADR 0022) by:
- Querying `SELECT id, title, message_count, updated_at, created_at FROM sessions WHERE id = ?`
- Mapping results to `ConversationInfo` structs (`updated_at` → `LastActivity`)

Enumeration comes from a `ConversationSource` that snapshots the sessions table and watches the WAL for changes, emitting row-id refs to the sink.

This requires a SQLite dependency. `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, no CGo) is preferred to avoid requiring a C compiler in the build chain.

### Phase 3: Status monitoring

Detect working/idle state by monitoring the SQLite database for changes.

The approach: watch the `.opencode/opencode.db-wal` file via inotify. On change, query the messages table for the latest message in the active session. If the most recent message has `role = "user"` and no subsequent assistant message with `finished_at IS NOT NULL`, the session is working. Otherwise idle.

An alternative is to propose that OpenCode write a lightweight status file (e.g. `.opencode/status.json`) upstream, which a `ConversationSource` (or a future status hook) could consume.

### Phase 4: Session resume

Blocked on upstream. OpenCode has no `--session <id>` CLI flag; session resume is TUI-only via an in-app session picker dialog. Once upstream adds CLI resume support, the adapter can implement `Resumer`.
