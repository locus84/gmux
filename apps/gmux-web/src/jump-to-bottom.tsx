/**
 * Floating "jump to bottom" button that overlays the bottom-right of an
 * xterm viewport when the user has scrolled up. Hidden when the viewport
 * is already at the bottom.
 *
 * Designed for any view that mounts an xterm.js Terminal: pass the
 * Terminal instance once it's been created. Tracks scroll position via
 * `term.onScroll`, which fires for both user-initiated and programmatic
 * scrolls, so the visibility stays in sync without polling.
 *
 * The button is positioned absolutely; the parent must establish a
 * positioning context (`.terminal-shell` already does, via
 * `position: relative`).
