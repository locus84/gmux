 * intent, the empty state is informative ("No sessions on workstation
 * right now"), and references in particular need to remain pinned so

 * Build the keys to send to `PATCH /v1/projects/{slug}/sessions` (or

 * a folder into. Two responsibilities:
 *
 *  1. Filter out sessions not owned by the folder's owner. A local
 *     folder may visually contain peer-owned sessions adopted via
 *     match rules; those don't live in the local projects.json, and
 *     sending them would add phantom entries on the daemon's next
 *     ReorderSessions merge.
 *
 *  2. Key sessions appropriately for the owning daemon's projects.json:
 *     - For references (folder.peer set, not a Local peer): the peer's
 *       projects.json keys by the original (unnamespaced) id, so we
 *       strip `@<peer>` from slugless ids before sending.
 *     - For local folders (folder.peer absent or Local): the parent's
 *       projects.json keys may include namespaced ids for Local-peer
 *       sessions, since the parent owns project assignment for them.
 *       We keep `@<peer>` for those sessions and strip nothing for
 *       genuinely local sessions.
 *     Slugged sessions always key by `s.slug`, which is never namespaced.
 *
 * Returns an empty array when no session in the request belongs to
 * the folder owner: caller should skip the PATCH entirely so the
 * daemon doesn't see an empty reorder.
