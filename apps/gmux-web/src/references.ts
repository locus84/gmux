// --- Peer reference liveness (ADR 0017) ---
//
// A reference points at a peer-owned project. Its `peer` name is the
// runtime key (folder bucketing, peer_projects, URLs, routing) and is a
// viewer-owned label frozen at first contact (ADR 0007 §7), so it
// doesn't drift and the viewer renders it directly — no name
// resolution. The only question left is liveness: is the host in the
// roster? Answered by node_id when the reference has one (immune to a
// reused name), else by name. That also blocks a freed-then-reused
// name from adopting a stale reference.
