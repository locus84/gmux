/**
 * Shared primitives for the terminal long-press sheets (link + text):
 * {@link SheetBackdrop} and {@link SheetButton}. One place for the portal,
 * keyboard, dismissal, and button styling all the sheets depend on.
 *
 * SheetBackdrop does three things every long-press sheet needs:
 *
 * 1. Portaled to <body>. Rendered in place, a sheet is a descendant of
 *    `.terminal-shell`, whose capture-phase touch handlers (pan + the
 *    long-press recognizer) then intercept every touch on it — a
 *    press-hold to select text re-fires long-press instead, and native
 *    selection never receives the touch. The portal moves the sheet out
 *    of that subtree so touches reach its content directly, and frees it
 *    from the shell's stacking context so it paints above the header and
 *    toolbar.
 *
 * 2. Constrained to the visible viewport via `--app-height` (the CSS lives
 *    on `.action-sheet-backdrop`). With the soft keyboard open the layout
 *    viewport still spans the full window behind the keyboard, so a plain
 *    inset:0 backdrop would centre the panel too low (partly occluded).
 *
 * 3. Dismiss on click, deferred a macrotask. click fires *after* the
 *    dismissing touch ends, so unmounting the sheet there can't tear down
 *    the terminal's iOS momentum-scroll layer mid-gesture. That mid-gesture
 *    teardown is exactly what killed inertial scrolling — the terminal
 *    coasts on a GPU layer that iOS drops if the DOM is torn down while the
 *    touch is live — when these dismissed on pointerup (pointerup fires
 *    while the touch is still in flight). We briefly used pointerup to
 *    catch a "quick tap right after the long-press" whose click got
 *    swallowed — but that swallowing turned out to be Orion-on-iOS
 *    specific; Safari/WebKit fire the click reliably, so we don't carry
 *    that workaround. The dismissal still runs through
 *    {@link dismissAfterGesture} (a setTimeout 0) as cheap insurance that
 *    the unmount always lands after the touch fully settles. SheetButton,
 *    by contrast, runs its *action* inline (synchronously): clipboard
 *    writes/reads and window.open must stay in the gesture task for WebKit
 *    to honour them (see {@link dismissAfterGesture}). The long-press
 *    recognizer is touch-gated, so
 *    the sheets only exist on touch devices; no keyboard-activation path to
 *    lose.
 *
 * Opening a long-press sheet also closes the on-screen keyboard by default;
 * keyboard-accessible dialogs can opt out so their autofocus is preserved.
 *
 * The panel (with its role/aria-label) is passed as children.

/**
 * Defer a sheet's *dismissal* (the DOM unmount) to the next macrotask
 * rather than running it inline in the click handler. click already fires
 * after the touch ends, so this is belt-and-suspenders: it guarantees the
 * sheet's DOM is removed only once the gesture has fully settled, so
 * removing it can never tear down the terminal's iOS momentum-scroll layer
 * mid-gesture — the regression we hit when these dismissed on pointerup.
 * Cheap to keep; see point 3 in the file header.
 *
 * Only the *dismissal* is deferred, never the action. Clipboard writes/reads
 * and window.open must run synchronously inside the click task: WebKit/Safari
 * ties them to the live user gesture and does not honour the spec's
 * "transient activation survives a task" model for them, so a setTimeout(0)
 * gets the write/open rejected or the popup blocked. SheetButton runs its
 * onActivate inline for that reason.
