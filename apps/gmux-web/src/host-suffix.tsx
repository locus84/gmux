/** Textual " · host" suffix for project headers.
 *
 * Renders the peer's name in muted body text after a project name
 * on the sidebar folder header and home dashboard rows. Turns the
 * disconnect color when the peer is unreachable.
 *
 * Locally-owned projects (peer omitted) render nothing: the viewer
 * is on that host, so naming it is noise. The suffix exists to flag
 * cross-host ownership; absence of the suffix means "here".
 *
 * `local` marks the name as the viewer's own host (used when a
 * multi-host setup labels local project headers too). The local host
 * is always reachable and is never in `peerStatusByName`, so we skip
 * the peer-status lookup entirely — otherwise a remote peer that
 * happens to share the local hostname would tint local headers red.
