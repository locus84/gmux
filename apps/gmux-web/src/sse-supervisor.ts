/**
 * Owns EventSource replacement rather than delegating recovery to the
 * browser's native retry. Native retry can terminate permanently after a
 * fatal response (notably 401/503), leaving an EventSource in CLOSED forever.
 *
 * Retries are bounded by elapsed time, cancellable, and jittered. The budget
 * model has three rules:
 *
 *  - Only a source that stayed open at least `stableOpenDurationMs` credits
 *    success. A server that accepts and immediately drops the stream keeps
 *    consuming one window instead of resetting it on every flap.
 *  - When the window runs out the supervisor stops entirely: no source, no
 *    timer, nothing to spin in a background tab. The UI offers a manual retry.
 *  - `revalidate()` (a wake) and `retry()` (a tap) are new information and
 *    always open a fresh window, including after exhaustion — a phone that
 *    returns after ten minutes must recover without a tap. They never stack
 *    sources: a pending retry or an in-flight attempt absorbs the wake, though
 *    a retry still parked deep in the backoff is pulled forward to now. A
 *    wake refreshes the deadline only; a tap also restores the backoff floor.
 *
 * Lifecycle revalidation replaces only an unhealthy or stale source: after
 * mobile or a frozen tab resumes, an OPEN readyState is not proof that the
 * TCP stream still delivers bytes, but a stream that delivered bytes moments
 * ago needs no new (full) bootstrap.
